# trimaldi-bmooney-project
Term project for Fall SD2 class

You begin your term project by building out a front-end prototype for our multi-tier Web application. Future
labs and projects will build upon this foundation. Your application is be an interactive, Web-based game based
on the following idea.

 1.1. Persistent Multi-User Maze Escape
Our game will be a unique spin on the idea of a maze escape. There is one maze that is traversed by multiple
users â€“ these users interact with the maze, but they do not directly interact with one another. A user can leave a
mark (or make some persistent change to the maze) which will afect other users who traverse the maze later.
For example, perhaps there is a pit or crevasse that blocks the way. If one user is able to fashion a way to cross
(e.g., finding planks to make a bridge, or fixing a rope swing to a ceiling beam), then user to pass that way later
on will be able to cross the pit without having to figure out a solution themselves. Similarly, if there is a wooden
plank laid across a pit, a user might pull that plank over to the far side after crossing, and subsequent users will
be unable to cross without figuring out an alternate solution. Note that these are just two examples, and you
may come up with your own ideas for your implementation.
In this way, there are elements of both cooperation and competition, while still being a single-player experience
in the moment of play.
