## Project Description

You wake up on the floor of a dark cellar. You don't remember your name, where you are, or how you got there.  The main objected of the game is to escape the maze without getting eliminated by any of the traps or monsters. If you so choose to play, you will be challenged, and maybe even have a hard time sleeping at night. If you lose, that is unfortunate and better luck next time. However, if you win... the prize is that of a mind blowing fortune that will add confusion, but understanding to your interpretation of the game -- Lights Out. 

## Getting Started

Start by cloning this repository and by setting up Node.JS. Install the necessary dependencies. Once these steps have been completed, from the command prompt, run node `server/lightsout.js`. Be sure to be in the **root directory.** For example, C:\Users\Tyler Rimaldi\Documents\SD2SemesterProj> would be where I would run: `server/lightsout.js` 

From there you will be able to access the web application via `localhost:3000`.
